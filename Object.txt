Java object = TextView
	- State is madeup of fields. A field is a variable; int, string, etc.
	- Methods from TextView = setText(), getText(), onDraw(). 
ImageView
	- Methods, such as setImage(), setScaleType(), onDraw().

Can use a class (TextView class, for instance) to create many TextView object
instances. 

Classes will start with capital letter, and camel case
	- Member Variables - field, or state of class. 
		> Ex) private int mImageId; 
	Inside the class ImageView is the method: 
		
		public void setImage(int imageId) {
			mImageId = imageId;	
		}

Context = way to access information about the app. 

Call a constructor:
	int quantity = 2;
	data type, variable name, initial value.
	
	TextView priceTextView = new TextView(context);
	- context object helps access application resources. 
	
	Button submitOrderButton = new Button(context);
	
	CatView sleepyCatView = new CatView("Tiger);

(Need to look at class source file to check what arguments to pass through upon construction)

Some classes require a Factory Method for construction: 
	Object data Type, Variable name = object Data type.Factory Method Name(Input Args)
	
	MediaPlayer player = MediaPlayer.create(context, R.raw.song)

Call method on object: object variable name.method name(input args).
	- titleTextView.setText("News");

Inside a class, use this.setText("Hello");
outside a class, use titleTextView.setText("Hello);

TextView priceTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.order_summary_text_view);
	- findViewById(R.id.order_summary_text_view) = returns a view
	- (TextView)  = casts into TextView type, because TextView is a child of View
