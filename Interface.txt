Interface = not implemented at all
	- No state
	- All methods are abstract (not implemented). 
	- Abstract methods are intentionally left blank so that developers can provide instructions for those methods: "Fill in the blank for when a view is clicked on."
	- Method signatures return value, method name, input parameters.

	> For Event Listener:
		1. Define the event listener (and the custom behavior for when the event happens):
	
		2. Create a new object instance of the event listener (using the constructor)
		3. Attach the listener to the view

Concrete Class = fully implemented
	- Contains state
	- Methods are fully implemented
