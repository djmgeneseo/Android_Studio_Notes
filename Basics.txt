Declare: int total;
Initialize: total = 10;
Concatenation: String father = "hello, " + "my " + "son."
			   father = father + " How are you?"

PEMDAS matters in Java 
int day1 = 15, day2 = 22, day 3 = 18; 
display(day1+day2+day3/3); 

This won't calculate the average. Need:
	display((day1+day2+day3)/3);
