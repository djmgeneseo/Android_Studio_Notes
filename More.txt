Resource folder contains: Images, strings, and styles

Layout: Android stores all layout files in xml. Tags refers to types of view objects in framework. Container views can contain other views. 

setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
	- cause xml layout resource to become inflated, convert everything in activity_main xml file into hierarchy of view objects in memory

Touch targets should be at least 48 dp's tall and wide.

Images should be moved into drawable folder, then called in XML as:
	android:src="@drawable/androidparty"

type to console:
Log.v("MainActivity", "The price is " + price);	

Chain method calls: 
EditText nameEditText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.nameField);
String name = nameEditText.getText().toString();
so first, return of nameEditText.getText(), then that is sent into toString() method,
which returns a value and stores it into the name variable
